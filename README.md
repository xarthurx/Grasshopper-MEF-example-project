# NOTE
As of 2025, MS has transit the `.NET Framework` to its new `.NET Core` series, and `hot reload` in VS2022 has all the functionality this repo provides.
This repo will be put into archive.


<h1 align="center">Grasshopper-MEF-Example-Project</h1>
An example project for developing Grasshopper plugin with the MEF approach.

## Goal 
After digging for a few days, I cannot really find a solution for **How to developing GH plugin without restarting Rhino/GH everytime I change the code**. So that's what this repo does -- An starter-kit for those who are familar with Grasshopper plugin development, but are annoyed with the tedious Rhino/GH restarting process.


### What is "MEF"?
#### Official Page
- [Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/mef/)

#### Short summary
- A framework that can link external `.dll`(s) to the main application online easily.
- For Grasshopper development, it allows us to link an external `dll`  to the loaded Grasshopper plugin in a way that: 
  - **the external `dll` can be _independently_ compiled and re-compiled without affecting the loaded Grasshopper plugin.**

*This approach will greatly increase the developing speed and eliminate the tedious waiting time with ease.*


## Project Structure
The project has following 3 sub-projects:
- `pluginComputation` (backend): The core library contains the actural functions that do the work.
- `pluginLoader` (frontend): The GH plugin that will be loaded in Grasshopper. It calls the function from the backend through the linker ("contract").
- `pluginContract`: The definition (required by MEF) that works as the link between the **backend** (`pluginComputation`) and the **frontend** (`pluginLoader`).

### When a RESTART is needed:
Once the `pluginLoader` is loaded in a Grasshopper session, changes made to the function body of any functions defined in `pluginContract`/`pluginComputation` do not require a restart. However, adding new functions (or change function names, return types, etc.) will require a hard **RESTART** of Rhino/Grasshopper.


## **Hot Reload** in Visual Studio 2022
The new [**Hot Reload**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-hot-reload/) functionality available in VS2022 achieves some of the goals this plugin tries to provide.

I'm currently not sure how much are the two overlap. But if you're using VS2022, you're welcome to try out.
